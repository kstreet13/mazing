# R package: mazing

<img src=inst/mazing.png height="200">

This package provides utilities for generating and plotting random mazes. The mazes are based on matrices, so can only consist of vertical and horizontal lines along a regular grid. But there is no need to use every possible space, so they can take on many different shapes.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/flametree")
```
