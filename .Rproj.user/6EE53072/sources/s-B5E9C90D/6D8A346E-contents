# R package: mazing

<img src=inst/mazing.png height="200">

This package provides utilities for generating and plotting random mazes. The mazes are based on matrices, so can only consist of vertical and horizontal lines along a regular grid. But there is no need to use every possible space, so they can take on many different shapes.

## Installation
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kstreet13/mazing")
```

## Example
```r
library(mazing)
mat <- matrix(rep(c(0,1,0), times=c(8,24,8)),
              nrow = 24, ncol = 40, byrow = TRUE)
mat[5,] <- 1
m <- as.maze(mat)

plot(m, walls = TRUE)
```
